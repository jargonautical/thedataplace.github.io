    <p>The founders of The Data Place are very active in the national open data community,
serving as organisers and trainers with the Open Data Institute Devon Node, running and participating in events around the themes of data, internet of things (IoT), smart cities and agritech. In 2015 we ran a conference, Beyond the Smart City, in partnership with the Met Office. In 2016 we also ran our first ThingsCamp, a participatory event on the theme of IoT. Subsequent events have taken place in London and Bristol and we are currently planning ThingsCamp 5 for 2018 in Birmingham.</p>
