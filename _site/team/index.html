  <h1>Team</h1>

  <div class="entry">
      
    <p>The founders of The Data Place are all active in the national open data community,
serving as organisers and trainers with the Open Data Institute Devon Node, running and participating in events around the themes of data, internet of things (IoT) and inclusive technology.</p>

<h3>Martin Howitt</h3>

<p>With a solid background as a technical lead, project manager, enterprise architect and
architecture team leader at Devon County Council and Bristol City Council, our technology lead and co-founder Martin has the depth and breadth of technical experience to understand all the things it takes to enable open data release from proprietary systems, as well as solid experience managing and delivering technology projects. For this project Martin will provide assurance that solutions are aligned to LORIC priorities, and will support data architecture, prototyping and data release activities, providing technical advice to client organisations to help them publish data more easily.</p>

<h3>Lucy Knight</h3>

<p>Our Data Lead and co-founder Lucy is an ODI Registered Trainer, a co-founder of ODI
Devon and Data Lead at Devon County Council. With over 20 years experience including production monitoring in the telecommunications industry, database management, performance reporting, data analysis and visualisation, and open data publication, she has built up significant expertise across all aspects of managing data and applying the range of skills to problem-solving. Lucy’s particular specialism is engaging new audiences with data concepts through video games, hobby electronics and visual arts, and in strengthening communication between technical and non-technical audiences.</p>

<h3>Simon Gough</h3>

<p>Our Design Lead Simon is an experienced service designer and facilitator. As Director of Redfront he’s led user research, prototyping and innovation workshops for Government
Digital Service, the Food Standards Agency, Department for International Trade, DCMS, the Met Office and many others. For the past five years he’s specialised in bringing together data and design through new tools and approaches; in addition to applying these methods to client work he’s also presented them as part of Service Design in Government and ODI Futures at Arup. Simon is an ODI Registered Trainer and a course tutor for Ravensbourne’s MDes where he leads the service design pathway. For the past three years he has been developing the curriculum to include transition design, systems thinking and economics for design.</p>

<h3>Chris Hunt</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://thisisthechris.co.uk/">creative technical developer</a> who has worked on many open source projects, Chris is a consummate developer of digital, data-rich products used across the public and private sectors - enabling clients to explore their data and ideas so they can grow and adapt to new ways of working, communicating and doing business. He brings in-depth understanding to this project of the code needed to make new ideas work and the flair for communication that is needed when bridging the gap between architecture and delivery.</p>

<h3>Sabrina Simpson</h3>

<p>Sabrina has a strong history of community building and management, having contributed to the creation of an independent <a href="https://thinqtanq.spaces.nexudus.com/en">hub and workspace</a> for freelancers and small businesses as well as a social enterprise supporting the growing <a href="https://www.digitalplymouth.com/">Digital Businesses community in Plymouth</a>.
