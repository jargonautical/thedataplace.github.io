We believe in making data work for everyone and that extends to the way we run our company. The Data Place was established as a social enterprise, but it’s not just the way we’re run that encapsulates our purpose.

We’re working hard to make data as open and democratic as possible. That means making it easier for everyone to share their data and get the most from it. We have huge plans for the future but for now we want to work closely with our users to make sure that they get a great data store for a more realistic price.
