        These interactive network diagrams never fail to fascinate.
        <br><br>
        But there's more to their appeal
        than simple entertainment. With this data structure we can see not just who's in a
        community but how they're connected to each other, the nature of the relationships
        and how they vary over time or across different categories.
        <br>

        It's all very well having a lot of data, but how do you put it to work?
        <br><br>
        That's where dashboards come in. Like the dashboard of a vehicle, they take the data
        and turn it into information you can use in the moment to make sense of
        what's happening and what your next action should be.

        Managing our parks and open spaces means we need to understand
        how they are used.
        <br><br>
        This low-cost experiment placed
        motion sensors along footpaths in several parks in Plymouth;
        analysing the data showed us how the patterns change over time and gave us some
        insights into how and why people use the space.

        No matter how sophisticated the toolset or how complex the problem, we
        almost always need to start with the same initial collection of demographic
        data; population, income, deprivation, working patterns and so on. This is
        what we call our 'data mince'.
