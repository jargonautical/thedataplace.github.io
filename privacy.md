The Data Place Ltd is a social enterprise and private limited company (number: 09966529) based at Fairbairn House, Higher Lane, Plymouth, UK PL1 2AN.
 
At TDP we aim to minimise the personal data we collect and process about you. We collect data about individuals in the following ways:
* When performing market research we may harvest existing publicly available data about organisations that might be potential partners or customers and this might identify individuals via their email addresses, LinkedIn profiles or Twitter handles.
* When people sign up to our mailing list we collect email addresses, and when people follow us on Twitter or join our Facebook page we get the corresponding information from those platforms
* When people buy our services we will collect contact and address information. If they buy those services online then we use a third-party processing platform  that stores the credit card information, etc for the purposes of carrying out the transaction.
* If you come to one of our events, we will hold your email address on file. You will also be asked if we have permission to take photos and publish them on blogs or for use in marketing materials: you will have the option to opt out of these at any time by contacting us.

Any of these records can be accessed and removed by emailing hello@thedata.place from the email address in question.
 
We use this information in the following ways:
* To send you email newsletters, IF you've opted in.
* To conduct and transact business with you, IF you initiate it
* To make you aware of activities we'd like you to consider being involved in, IF you've opted in.
 
If you've had contact with us and aren't sure if you've opted in to any of the above processing, you can contact us and we will respond within 1 working day, giving you the option to remove your data if you want to.
 
We donâ€™t share personally identifiable information with third parties. If we think you'd benefit from being introduced to someone we'd ask you before we do that and it would be a manual process.
