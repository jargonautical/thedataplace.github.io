The Data Place is a social enterprise with a mission to provide accessible data infrastructure with ancillary products and services that:

* support communities through open access to critical data;
* facilitate the key resources for product/service innovation and smart city initiatives;
* foster a more collaborative and growing digital ecosystem; and
* provide the means for public and civic organisations to better serve their stakeholders.

We feel, above all, that the open data revolution is being held back by a lack of accessible, flexible, cost-effective infrastructure; we are on course to provide data infrastructure as a commodity, for anyone and everyone.
